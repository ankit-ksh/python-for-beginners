If you want to read these notes offline, download the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ankit-ksh/python-for-beginners) for this course and open the docs folder inside it in your favourite markdown editor. I recommend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). After downloading obsidian, you can open the docs folder inside the repository as a vault and then you can read it and modify it to your taste.
