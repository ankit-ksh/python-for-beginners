# Basics of Computing

If you are new to computers and coding, this lesson is just for you. By the end, you’ll know the simple ideas you need before starting Python.

## What is a computer?

- A computer is a machine that follows instructions very fast.
- Hardware: the physical parts (like the CPU = the “brain”, memory = short‑term storage, disk = long‑term storage, keyboard/mouse/screen).
- Software: the programs (apps) that tell the hardware what to do.
- Examples: calculators, smartphones, laptops, game consoles, smart watches, smart TVs.

## What is a program?

- A program is a list of instructions the computer follows step by step.
- Python lets us write these instructions in human‑friendly words.
- Examples: calculator app, web browser, camera app, microwave timer, school timetable spreadsheet.

## The operating system (OS)

- The OS is the “manager” that runs programs and looks after files and devices.
- You use it every time you open a folder, launch an app, or save a file.
- Examples: Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Linux (computers); Android, iOS (phones/tablets).

## Files and folders (the basics)

- A file stores information (text, pictures, code) and lives inside folders.
- Code files are plain text. Python files usually end with .py (example: `hello.py`).
- A path shows where a file lives (like an address). Example: `docs/notes/module1-introduction/why-learn-python.md`.
- Examples: files — `notes.txt`, `photo.jpg`, `song.mp3`, `hello.py`; folders — `Documents`, `Pictures`, `Downloads`.

## Editors vs IDEs

- You write code in a text editor. It’s like Google Docs but for code.
- Editors highlight mistakes and help you format your code nicely (full IDEs add more tools in one place).
- Examples: editors — VS Code, Notepad++, IDLE, Thonny; IDEs — PyCharm.

## The terminal (or command line)

- The terminal is a place to type commands instead of clicking buttons.
- We can run Python programs by typing commands there. It’s just another way to talk to the computer.
- Examples: Windows — Command Prompt/PowerShell; macOS — Terminal; Linux — Bash.

## Programming languages and Python

- A programming language is how humans tell computers what to do.
- Python is popular because it’s readable and great for beginners.
- Python is an “interpreted” language: the Python program (the interpreter) reads your .py file and runs it line by line.
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, Scratch, Java, C/C++.

## How a tiny Python program works

- You write instructions in a file (for example, `hello.py`).
- The Python interpreter runs it.
- Example ideas you’ll meet first: printing messages, reading input, doing math.
- Example: create `hello.py` that prints a greeting, then asks for a name and says hello.

## Variables (friendly mental model)

- A variable is a labeled box where you keep a value.
- Examples of values you’ll use soon:
	- Numbers (like `12`, `3.14`)
	- Text (called “strings”, like `"Hello"`)
	- True/False (called “booleans”)

## Errors are normal

- Everyone makes mistakes. The computer shows error messages to help you fix them.
- Two common kinds:
	- Syntax error: the code is written in a way Python doesn’t understand (like a missing `)` or quote).
	- Runtime error: the code starts to run but hits a problem (like dividing by zero).

## Good habits in programming

- Save your files with clear names (no spaces if possible, use `-` or `_`).
- Run your code often in small steps (test after each small change).
- Add short comments to explain why, not just what.
- Keep your code tidy; it makes bugs easier to find (consistent spacing and naming).
- Examples: file names — `hello_world.py`, `my-notes.txt`; example comment — `# ask the user for their age`.

## A tiny glossary

- CPU: the part that “thinks” and follows instructions.
- Memory (RAM): short‑term storage for running programs.
- Disk (Storage): long‑term storage for your files.
- Editor: the app where you write code (e.g., VS Code).
- Terminal: a text window where you type commands.
- Interpreter: a program (like Python) that reads and runs your code.
