# Why Learn Programming — and Why Python?

This short page answers two questions: why learn programming at all, and why we’re starting with Python.

## 1) Why learn programming?

- Become a problem solver: turn ideas into tools that help you and others.
- Make your own things: small games, homework helpers, to‑do apps, or a class website.
- Automate boring stuff: rename hundreds of files, sort photos, fetch scores automatically.
- Think clearly: break big problems into small steps — a superpower for school and life.
- Share with the world: publish a simple script or app and thousands can use it.

Starter project ideas you’ll try soon

- Number guessing game or flashcards quiz
- Habit tracker in the terminal
- Weather checker using a public API

## 2) Why choose Python?

- Easy to read: fewer symbols, looks close to English.
- Beginner‑friendly: great for first programs and quick experiments (REPL).
- Powerful and popular: used for web apps, data science, AI/ML, automation, and more.
- Batteries included: strong standard library to do a lot without extra installs.
- Huge community: tons of tutorials, examples, and help when you’re stuck.
- Free and open source: runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- Dropbox (desktop client and backend components)
- Spotify (data pipelines, services, and analysis)
- Reddit, Pinterest, Quora (production web backends)
- Blender and many games/tools use Python for scripting
