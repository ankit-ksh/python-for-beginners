# Getting Started — Hello, World!

In this quick guide you’ll install the tools, write your first Python program, and run it. Choose the option that suits you.

## Where can we run Python?
- On our computer
- IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) - officially by Python software foundation
- IPython
- Code editors (VS code, Sublime text etc)
- On the cloud (Google Colab, Replit etc)


## Prerequisites

- Install Python 3 (latest stable): https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Check it works:

```bash
python --version     # on Windows (sometimes 'py -V')
python3 --version    # on macOS/Linux
```

If you see a version like 3.x.x, you’re ready.

## Notes for Windows, macOS, and Linux

- Windows
	- Use Command Prompt or PowerShell. If `python` doesn’t work, try `py` (e.g., `py -V`, `py hello.py`).
	- When installing Python, check “Add python.exe to PATH”.
	- In VS Code’s terminal, you can choose your shell (PowerShell or Command Prompt).
- macOS
	- Use the Terminal app. Run with `python3` and install packages with `pip3`.
	- If the installer is blocked, allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security. Optional: `brew install python` if you use Homebrew.
	- VS Code’s default shell is zsh; commands in this guide work the same.
- Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora/Arch, etc.)
	- Python 3 is often preinstalled. Use `python3` and `pip3`.
	- Install or update via your package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`).
	- VS Code terminal uses your default shell (bash/zsh/fish).

## Option A: VS Code (recommended)

1) Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2) Open VS Code. Install the “Python” extension by Microsoft (search: Python).
3) Create a folder for your code (e.g., Desktop/python-projects/hello-world).
4) In VS Code, File → Open Folder… and open that folder.
5) Create a new file named `hello.py` and add:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

6) Run it (pick one):
	- Press the “Run Python File” ▶ button at the top right, or
	- Open the terminal in VS Code (View → Terminal) and run:

```bash
python hello.py      # Windows (or 'py hello.py')
python3 hello.py     # macOS/Linux
```

You should see: `Hello, world!`

Tip: If VS Code can’t find Python, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) → “Python: Select Interpreter” and choose your Python 3 interpreter.

## Option B: IDLE (comes with Python)

IDLE is a simple editor included with Python.

1) Open IDLE (search your apps for “IDLE”).
2) File → New File.
3) Type the code below and save as `hello.py`:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

4) Run → Run Module (or press F5). You’ll see the output in the IDLE shell.

---

## Option C: Replit (in your browser)

1) Go to https://replit.com/ and create a free account.
2) Click “Create Repl” → choose “Python”.
3) In `main.py`, type:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

4) Click “Run” to see the output on the right.

---

## Common issues (quick fixes)

- “python not found” on Windows: try `py hello.py` or reinstall Python and check “Add python.exe to PATH” during setup.
- On macOS/Linux, use `python3` instead of `python`.
- VS Code still can’t run Python: use “Python: Select Interpreter” and pick the 3.x version.

## Make it yours

Change the message and ask for a name.

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

Run it and type your name!
